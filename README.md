# install-scripts

Some installation scripts that can be handy. For any script file `X.sh`, just run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cglacet/install-scripts/master/X.sh)"
```

For example, to install git on osx:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cglacet/install-scripts/master/osx/install-git.sh)"
```
